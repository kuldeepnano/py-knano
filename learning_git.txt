Git (Version control system)
change -> add -> commit

<br> is new line character in README.md file (from HTML)

Clone
    git clone <-link->
Status
    git status

cd : change directory
cd .. : going to parent directory
ls : lising items in working directory
ls -a : lising all items in working directory

untracted : git doesn't know the file
modified : git knows the file has been changed
staged : git knows file is ready to commit
unmodified : git knows the file

Add
    git add <-file->
Commit 
    git commit -m "message"
To check all the commits
    git log

Initialize git in local repo
    git init 
Adding the github repo link to local repo
    git remote add origin <-link->
To check the remote origin
    git remote -v 
To check the branch (it will show all the branches and current branch highlight)
    git branch
To rename the branch to "main"
    git branch -M main
To go to other branch
    git checkout <-branch_name->
To create new branch
    git checkout -b <-branch_name->
To delete a branch
    git branch -d <-branch_name->

Merging current branch to other branch via git
    git diff <-branch_name->    To check the difference
    git merge <-branch_name_>   To merge to another branch
Merging via Pull request on Github is also possible and more preferable. (It is also a commit.)
Pulling the latest changes and commits from remote to local.
    git pull origin main

Undoing changes
Case 1: staged uncommited changes
    git reset <-file_name->     For individual files
    git reset                   For all files
Case 2: commited changes (for 1 commit)
    git reset HEAD~1

Case 3: commited changes (for multiple commit)
First find out the hash of the commit with command : git log
Then undo to specific commit with its hash
    git reset <-commit_hash->           To undo in just git
    git reset --hard <-commit_hash->    To undo in editor as well
Fork: get a copy of other's repo to own account (GitHub option)
